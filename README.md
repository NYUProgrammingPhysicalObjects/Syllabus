##DM-GY 9103A Programming Physical Objects##

In this graduate course, students will study physical computing as a means to create interactive systems that translate human expressions from the surrounding world to the digital world, using both software and hardware.  Taking the human body as a given, students will learn how a computer converts the changes in energy given off by our bodies – sound, light, heat, motion, etc. – into changing electronic signals that computers can read and interpret. Students will learn to build and program their own micro-controller board, with an emphasis on techniques and approaches for the generation of temporal and spatial processes.  Through discussions of interactivity, students will design computing applications that utilize these forms of physical expression.  Possibilities include the control of kinetic sculptures, custom performance interfaces, installations, the presence of sound or light and reactive/interactive/responsive works.

##Program Objectives:

At a graduate level students will:

- develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
- develop technical skills to realize
- develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
- develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

##Course Objectives:

1.	To gain an articulate an awareness and sensitivity of interactive systems, including the difference between reactive, interactive and responsive systems
2.	To design engaging interactive systems, which encourage interaction and exploration
3.	To design systems which liberate the computer from traditional definitions and to exist within the physical world around us.
4.	Competent circuit construction
5.	Further development/utilization of programming skills
6.	Completion of several projects for group critiques
